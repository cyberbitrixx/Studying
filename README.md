# Studying (WIP)

## Description
This repository serves as a personal learning journal, documenting my journey as iOS software engineer. It contains code snippets, examples, and practice exercises from various topics and concepts I've explored. Each directory represents a different subject area, such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) or Working With Data in iOS, allowing me to organize and reference my learning materials efficiently.
I tried to not cluster the code with comments I added along the way, but their main purpose is providing explanations and insights into the lessons learned, so treat them more as self-explanatories for myself.
