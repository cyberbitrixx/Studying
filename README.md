# Studying

## Description
This repository serves as a personal learning journal, documenting my journey as a software engineer. It contains code snippets, examples, and practice exercises from various topics and concepts I've explored. Each directory represents a different subject area, such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) or Working With Data in iOS, allowing me to organize and reference my learning materials efficiently.
I tried to not cluster the code with comments I added along the way, but their main purpose is providing explanations and insights into the lessons learned, so treat them more as self-explanatories for myself.

## Navigation

* [Data In iOS](https://github.com/cyberbitrixx/Studying/tree/c4ac6c9502aecc614b72ce45f755cf7b080cb0c9/Data%20In%20iOS) - a codebase I developed along my studying journey on Working With Data in iOS Meta course (and not only that)  and covers concepts of workin with RESTful API's, JOSN, Core Data, including decoding, sorting, filtering and presenting data in iOS apps.
* [OOP Principles](https://github.com/cyberbitrixx/Studying/tree/995fe979a102adaf028b021092f5fa7142df9093/OOP%20Principles) - covers Object-Oriented Programming principles on real code examples and mainly consists of playgrounds I was using as my notes and space for pracrice when mastering OOP paradigm.
* [MATLAB vs Julia](https://github.com/cyberbitrixx/Studying/tree/d3cf6d50601ec156b8e7478552ab323d977338fd/MATLAB%20vs%20Julia) - a directory that contains basic MD and code related to studying MATLAB and Julia programming language. Acquired during my data science and database development internship at Washington State University.
* [Coordinator](https://github.com/cyberbitrixx/Studying/tree/4446fe80ca32d12883ce6b6d78a35dcc9cba17d2/Coordinator) - my notes on when I studied Coordinator design pattern in iOS apps.
* [Objective-C](https://github.com/cyberbitrixx/Studying/tree/main/Objective-C) - my notes and cheat sheets of my journey on Objective-C exploration. While I prefer in-depth knowledge of anything I study, this time I was limited in time with this objective. So everything you will find here mainly contains knowledge that meets these goals: reading and understanding Objective-C on the level that will allow me to work with Objective-C legacy code, writing and debugging iOS apps using Objective-C, solving basic CodeWars/Leetcode problems in this language.
